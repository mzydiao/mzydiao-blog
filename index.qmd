Hi, I'm Michael! :)

I graduated from MIT in 2023 with an M.Eng. in Computer Science (see my [thesis](/research/thesis/index.qmd)!) and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science and Mathematics.
I hope to use this site as a space to collect and share [cool ideas](/blog.qmd) I've stumbled across.
Hopefully they interest you as well!
