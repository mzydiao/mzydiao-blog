Hi, I'm Michael! :)

I graduated from MIT in 2023 with an M.Eng. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science and Mathematics.
<!-- College might be over for me, but certainly not the endeavor to learn! -->
I hope to use this site as a space to collect and share cool ideas I've stumbled across.
Hopefully they interest you as well!
